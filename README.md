# Fantano playlist generator

## About
Youtuber Anthony fantano does weekly track roundups in which he rates songs, the idea of this project is to collect the best rated songs and put them into a Spotify playlist.
Then a user can simply follow the playlist through the api.
I designed it this way because I find it easier, maybe in the future I'll make it so that the api creates a brand new private playlist for each user.

## Enpoints
Here you get taken to a Spotify page, where you have to grant the app permission to modify your playlists, after that a new playlist is added
```
