    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Youtuber Anthony fantano does weekly track roundups in which he rates songs, the idea of this project is to
        collect the best rated songs and put them into a Spotify playlist.
        Then a user can simply follow the playlist through the api.
        I designed it this way because I find it easier, maybe in the future I'll make it so that the api creates a
        brand new private playlist for each user.

    <h2>How to</h2>
    <p>
        Go <a href=" /start">here</a> and grant my app permission to modify your Spotify playlists
