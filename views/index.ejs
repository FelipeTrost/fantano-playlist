            <p>
                Youtuber Anthony fantano does weekly track roundups in which he rates songs, the idea of this project is
                to
                collect the best rated songs and put them into a Spotify playlist.
                Then a user can simply follow the playlist through the api.
                I designed it this way because I find it easier, maybe in the future I'll make it so that the api
                creates a
                brand new private playlist for each user.
